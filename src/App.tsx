  //too complicated to keep a track of.

  //as instead of keep getting the products from server like you would in a real app;
  //I decided to just get them once and cache as I didn't have time to put in a full REST api over the weekend.
  //Also the way I store items in the cart is just using an ID rather than the whole product data.
  //This means I need to lookup the products. This could be done with REST calls which seems inefficient,
  //as does storing the product data in the product component AND the cart list. 
  //So I've got a global context of all the available products.
